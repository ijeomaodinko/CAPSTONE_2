  <p>Setup local dev server
Finally, it's time to improve your developer experience. When working on the project you will not want to run the build command from the terminal every time you make a change in the code. Therefore go ahead and install a webpack dev server, which will watch your source files, generate compiled distribution files and even refresh the browser every time you save changes in the source code.</p>
